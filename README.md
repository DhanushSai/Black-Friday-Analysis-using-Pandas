# Black-Friday-Analysis-using-Pandas
In this project, we dive into the black friday data to gain insights and valuable information through python pandas

# Objective
The key objectives were to derive actionable insights from Black Friday sales data that can inform business decisions related to marketing, sales, product development, pricing and customer experience. The analysis tried to identify revenue drivers, high-value customers, product demand - which can ultimately help boost revenues.

# Introduction
- Understand Customer Demographics: Analyze attributes like gender, age group, occupation etc. to identify key customer demographics that are driving sales.
- Identify Popular Products: Find which products are purchased more frequently and contribute maximum revenue.
- Analyze Purchasing Trends: Understand purchasing behavior across age groups, gender, product categories to identify trends and patterns.
- Find Revenue Drivers: Figure out which customer segments, regions, products etc. contribute maximum revenue.
- Identify High Value Customers: Analyze purchase amounts to tag high value customers for targeting.
- Make Recommendations: Based on insights from data, provide recommendations to marketing and sales teams.
- Optimize Marketing Spend: Figure out which customer demographics, regions, channels should be targeted to optimize marketing budget.
- Enhance Customer Experience: Identify ways to tailor customer experience for different segments by analyzing their behavior.
- Forecast Demand: Build models to forecast future demand across products based on past purchase data.
- Optimize Pricing: Set competitive and profitable pricing by analyzing price sensitivity and purchase volumes across products.

# Features
Based on the dataset and analysis in the Jupyter notebook, here are some of the key features or variables that were part of the Black Friday sales data:

- User_ID - Unique ID assigned to each customer
- Product_ID - Unique ID assigned to each product
- Gender - Gender of the customer (Male/Female)
- Age - Age group of the customer
- City_Category - Category of the city (A/B/C)
- Stay_In_Current_City_Years - How long the customer stayed in the city
- Marital_Status - Marital status of the customer
- Occupation - Occupation code of the customer
- Product_Category_X - Category code for the product purchased
- Purchase - Purchase amount of the transaction
- The features can be broadly classified into:
- Customer Attributes: User_ID, Gender, Age, City_Category, Stay_In_Current_City_Years, Occupation, Marital_Status
- Product Attributes: Product_ID, Product_Category_1/2/3
- Transaction Attribute: Purchase (Target variable)

# Technologies used
